1. Fitting automated tests in the Recipe project development pipeline would be (3) after all deployment is completed because end-to-end tests are automated test casses which involve emulating user actions from start to finish. In order to emulate users, deployment must be completed or else there is nothing for users to interact with. 
2. No, you would not use end to end tests to check if a function is returning a correct input. This is because you want to look at an action from start to finish and calling a function is only a part of an action triggered by an emulated user.
